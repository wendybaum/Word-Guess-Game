## Option Two: Word Guess Game (Challenge - Recommended)

Theme: Florida Native Bees

Word Guess Game that listens for key events as you type.

Displays the following on the page:

 --Press any key to get started!

 --Wins: (# of times user guessed the word correctly).

   * If the word is `madonna`, displays it like this when the game starts: `_ _ _ _ _ _ _`.

   * As the user guesses the correct letters, reveals them: `m a d o _  _ a`.

 --Number of Guesses Remaining: (# of guesses remaining for the user).

 --Letters Already Guessed: (Letters the user has guessed, displayed like `L Z Y H`).

After the user wins/loses the game automatically chooses another word and is ready for the user play it.

##### Word Guess Game Bonuses completed:

1. Play a sound or song when the user guesses their word correctly, like in our demo.
2. Write some stylish CSS rules to make a design that fits your game's theme.
3. **HARD MODE:** Organize your game code as an object, except for the key events to get the letter guessed. This will be a challenge if you haven't coded with JavaScript before, but we encourage anyone already familiar with the language to try this out.
4. Save your whole game and its properties in an object.
5. Save any of your game's functions as methods, and call them underneath your object declaration using event listeners.
